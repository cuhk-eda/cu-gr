CUGR
======================================
CUGR is a VLSI global routing tool developed by the research team supervised by Prof. Evangeline F. Y. Young at The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK).
Different from previous global routers whose quality is usually measured by wirelength and resource overflow,
CUGR is a detailed routability-driven global router and its solution quality is solely determined by the final detailed routing results.
In particular, our global router adopts several efficient and effective methods to generate a set of connected rectangles to guide the detailed router:
* A sophisticated probability-based cost scheme
* An optimal 3D pattern routing technique that combines 2D pattern routing and layer assignment
* A multi-level maze routing utilizes two levels of routing
* A patching technique that adds useful route guides to further improve the detailed routability.
* ...

More details are in the following paper:

(CUGR supports ICCAD'19 benchmarks ([v2](http://iccad-contest.org/2019/Problem_C/iccad19_benchmarks_v2.tar.gz), [hidden](http://iccad-contest.org/2019/Problem_C/iccad19_hidden_benchmarks.tar.gz)).
This version of code is consistent with the DAC paper.)

## 1. How to Build

**Step 1:** Download the source code. For example,
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/cuhk-eda/cu-gr
```

**Step 2:** Go to the project root and build by
```bash
$ cd cu-gr
$ scripts/build.py -o release
```

Note that this will generate two folders under the root, `build` and `run` (`build` contains intermediate files for build/compilation, while `run` contains binaries and auxiliary files).
More details are in [`scripts/build.py`](scripts/build.py).

### 1.1. Dependencies

* [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) (version >= 5.5.0) or other working c++ compliers
* [CMake](https://cmake.org/) (version >= 3.8)
* [Boost](https://www.boost.org/) (version >= 1.58)
* [Python](https://www.python.org/) (version 3, optional, for utility scripts)
* [Innovus®](https://www.cadence.com/content/cadence-www/global/en_US/home/tools/digital-design-and-signoff/soc-implementation-and-floorplanning/innovus-implementation-system.html) (version 18.1, optional, for design rule checking and evaluation)
* [Rsyn](https://github.com/RsynTeam/rsyn-x) (a trimmed version is used, already added under folder `rsyn`)
* [Dr. CU](https://github.com/cuhk-eda/dr-cu) (v4.1.1, optional, official detailed router for ICCAD'19 Contest, [binary](http://iccad-contest.org/2019/Problem_C/drcu_june19.zip) is already included under the root)

## 2. How to Run

### 2.1. Toy Test

#### Run Binary Directly

Go to the `run` directory and run the binary `iccad19gr` with a toy case `ispd18_sample`:
```bash
$ cd run
$ ./iccad19gr -lef ../toys/iccad2019c/ispd18_sample/ispd18_sample.input.lef -def ../toys/iccad2019c/ispd18_sample/ispd18_sample.input.def -output ispd18_sample.solution.guide -threads 8
```

#### Run with a Wrapping Script

Instead of running the binary directly, you may also use a wrapping script `run.py` to save typing and do more:
```bash
$ cd run
$ ./run.py 8s -p ../toys/
```

If Innovus® has been properly installed in your OS, an evaluation can be launched by
```bash
$ ./run.py 8s -s eval -p ../toys/
```
In the end, a result table will be printed in the terminal.

Furthermore, the solution can be visualized by
```bash
$ ./run.py 8s -s view -p ../toys/
```
which gives:

![ispd18_sample.solution.png](/toys/iccad2019c/ispd18_sample/ispd18_sample.solution.png)

The three steps, `route`, `eval` and `view` of `run.py` can also be invoked in a single line:
```bash
$ ./run.py 8s -s route eval view -p ../toys/
```
More usage about `run.py` can be known by the option `-h`.

### 2.2. Batch Test

The benchmarks can be downloaded from [the hompage of ISPD'18 Contest ](http://www.ispd.cc/contests/18/#benchmarks).
You may let `run.py` know the benchmark path by setting OS environmental variable `BENCHMARK_PATH` or specifying it under option `-p`.
Then,
```bash
$ cd run
$ ./run.py <benchmark_name...|all> -s route eval [option...]
```
